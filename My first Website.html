<h2>HTML</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank"title="html specification">The HyperText Markup Language,</a> or HTML is the standard markup
language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
and scripting languages such ads JavaScript.
<strong>Web</strong> browsers receive HTML documents from a <U>web</u> server or from local
storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
structure of a web page semantically and originally
included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
<img src="html.jpg" widt="100%"> <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and
other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
<p>Tags such as <"img"> and <"input"/> directly introduce content into
the page. Other tags such as <"p"> surround and provide information a
bout document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript,
 which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines
 the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former
 maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
 standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
