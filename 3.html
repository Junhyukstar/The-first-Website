<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
 language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.JavaScript
 is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
 It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
 object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
<p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the
World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page
behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries. Most web
browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code
on the user's device.</p>
<p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional,
 and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
 interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
 standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
